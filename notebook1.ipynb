Probably the easiest one to install would be the [SAOImage DS9 Astronomical Data Visualization Application](http://ds9.si.edu/site/Download.html).\n",

Go to the page and enter the name of an object you know (for example \"coma cluster\") in the \"Coordinates or Source\" field, then under the Optical:DSS: section select the \"DSS1 Red\" and press submit. This should open another page which has an image that looks similar to this:\n",
